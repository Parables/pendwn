# pendwn
Pen it down, get it done!!!

## Motivation
Initially [drafted](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nsJ_mqfDuPeoyzQ6Ho5skw88ACtzVD-DAotg9WgVTSs/edit) as an activity logger, now aims to be a one stop productivity app.

Simply tell it what you are up to and it will ensure you do it by checking up on you.

You've just found for yourself, the world's most annoying personal assistant.

It will keep tabs on everything around you and help you manage your life from one central place.

## Story
Pendwn(pronounced "pen down" but can be called "pen done") was born about by a personal problem I have.

I exhibit mild symptoms of [ADHD](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/adhd/facts.html). I am inconsitent, I do things randomly and I hardly stick to planned task managers
and too sturborn to discipline myself and so none of the productivity apps out there doesn't fit me.

And even if I manage to stay disciplined enough, 
I always get occupied with the thing I am working on so I forget to check them of the todo list.

I always start something, but never finish it because I eventually drift to do other things(related or unrelated).

Also, I am a big procastinator, once I drift away from a task, I find it hard to return to it. 

Like the saying "out of sight, out of mind", once I start drifting, that task/project would surely become abandoned.
I keep procastinatig things making me to fail at meeting deadlines and losing clients.

Take a quick look at my repositories on Github and it would clearly paint the picture.
As at now, there are 209 repositories on my personal github acount including forks from other repos.

Whether its a fork or an original project, it got there because I was once working on it.

Sadly enough, none of these projects have seen the light of day as the sit on cold archives or GitHub servers
instead of running on production servers available for end users.

Instead of forcing myself to be disciplined, pendwn would allow me to throw everything I want/have to do at it,
then it would --annoyingly-- intelligently check up on me if I am still working on it or I have deviated.

If I have deviated, like google maps, it should allow me to keep going and track my current activity
and eventually reroute back so I don't totally abandon what I have started.

It will allow me to track everything I do(and I mean everything), how much time I spend on things, and intelligently spread the time I have
across multiple tasks so that I get more things done instead of spending months/years doing one thing or 
abandoning them when they are out of sight.

You can start with a bigger goal, then break it down into simpler achievable tasks.And pendwn will make sure they don't sit there in your todos list forever.

Because it would be collecting lots of personal information, I belive making the source codes open source will allow anyone to figure
out what pendwn does with your data.

Packaged as a Docker image, You can self-host pendwn on any cloud provider of your choice. A minimal compute instance like Linode's $5 compute instance will do just fine for personal use.
